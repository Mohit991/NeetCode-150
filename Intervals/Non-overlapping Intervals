#We want to remove intervals and make the list non overlapping. We first sort the array, once we have done that
#then we will go through the array and we will pick every interval, and compare it with interval, which is 
#represented by j. Now if the intervals are merging that we will want to remove one of them so they dont merge 
#anymore. We can remove either one but we will remove the one which has the lesser end. This way we will be 
#minimizing the number of intervals we need to remove. If intervals dont merge we move on. 
#TC - O(NlongN)
